### Analysis :

First, when I Download this challenge I take first shot by reg shot tool after that I run the sample and after it finish I take a second shot but I didn't found anything useful so I open the challenge by notebad++

![](/assets/images/CTF/Reg/notepad++.PNG)
You can see  file contain 4 parts 

1) Regkey[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce]
Which makes his value PART2 
2) In the second part you found  PowerShell script which is searched at C: for files with len 0x00026A83 and has an extension.REG, then I copy the content of the file to tmpreg.bat  
3) another PowerShell script that takes tmpreg.bat and XOR its content after it skips 000643 bytes and put the encoding file a    tmp + random +.exe
4) Random Values

Now we have abstract knowledge to know what is done here 
I ran the sample and go to Regedit

This key works when we restart the machine 


After restarting I go to %temp% and found these files .

I will make an analysis for  tmp1224721815.exe
When I run it close quickly 

so I open it at ida and when see strings I found EGCRT{ Which is the start of the flag so I know I'm at on the right way

 When I open the function that uses this string I found It assembles the Flag at two-part first char by char and second block by block

First Part: 
![](/assets/images/CTF/Reg/firstpart.PNG)

Second Part: 
![](/assets/images/CTF/Reg/secondpart.PNG)

When I was debugging I didn't find any problem but at second part 
I was hit with memory exception so I will split the second part to explain where is it happening 


You found here {getenv} function which return value of environment variable 
But I found it pass var name doesnâ€™t exist and then check if the return value is zero which every iteration is zero or value that not reference to memory address then It get value from reference [rbx+r13*8]and compare it with the return value which made memory exception

![](/assets/images/CTF/Osiris/Reg/firstsecond.PNG)


I patch the jnz to je and change the value of RAX every iteration to avoid memory exception 
And if the compare not equal it jumps to a bad decision else add it to the flag
And then add {_} 


![](/assets/images/CTF/Reg/secondsecond.PNG)



After all iteration that the flag was assembled at Destination 
Flag: EGCERT{r3v3rseing_r3g_f1l3s_with_3mb3dd3d_ex3cutabl3_c0d3_9ccb6bd3}
